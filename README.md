The Internet of Things(IoT) is the future Internet evolution towards a network of interconnected smart objects such as computers, smart phones, smart watches, smart televisions, smart cars and many more. It is a matter of concern that our current infrastructure may not be able to handle large amount of data efficiently involving the growing number of smart IoT devices. As a solution, in this paper we came up with proposing a hybrid model of IoT infrastructure, as compared to the existing infrastructure to overcome its challenges. Our proposed infrastructure will be a collaboration of Fog computing combined with intelligent use of Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) which will be serving as a machine to machine communication protocol. This model will be able to transfer data reliably and systematically with low latency, less bandwidth, heterogeneity and maintaining the Quality of Service(QoS) befittingly.
In this project we have created a FoG Cloud computing system with IoT and network infrastructure in mind. This is the theoritical implementation of below publications.
